# Human-Face-Generation-Using-Gan
This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically StyleGAN, to generate realistic human faces. It includes features for modifying attributes like hair color, skin tone, and facial features through a web-based UI using React and Flask. The model is trained to enhance quality, stability, and variation in face generation.
